    <p class="divide">----------</p>
    <p>In late June of 2024, The Ohio Sigmas SMP server began. Excuse the name of the server. The owner, TomMustBe12 had a server before. But since he was too dumb to figure it out, he had to use Aternos (gross). The Ohio Sigmas server has upgraded from around 1-2 GB of RAM to 10 GB. That's an improvement. You can apply to join <a href="../contact/">here</a> or you can sit and play around with this weird cube. (TomMustBe12 didn't know what else to do for the rest of the page to make it interesting, so here is a stupid badly coded Minecraft grass block cube.)</p>
