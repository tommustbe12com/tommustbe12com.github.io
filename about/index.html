    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>I am a person <sub>nah really?</sub>. I live in the United States, and I like to code, play video games, and do more things in the tech realm.</p>
  <p>If you have seen my channel, you can expect a video from me at least once a week, (usually on Thursdays), about any subject.</p>
  <p>Annnnnnd, if you haven't seen my YouTube channel - you can view it <a href="https://youtube.com/@TomMustBe12">here</a>. </p>
  <h2>What do I do?</h2>
  <p>You've probably seen some of my videos. If you have, you know I like coding and gaming, as well as some other tech-y things.</p>
  <h2>Future Video Stuff</h2>
  <p>Aha! Now you can get some good information from this website. VERY soon, somewhere around June/July, I will release videos for coding your very own DISCORD BOT.</p>
  <p>Yep! That's right. A Discord Bot.</p>
  <p>And, that's not all. Before then, very soon, I will be doing a video with me attempting to BEAT MINECRAFT by myself. It will be a long video. But, I will try.</p>
  <p>Along with this, I will be doing gaming videos with friends, and more coding videos.</p>
