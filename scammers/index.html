        <h1>Scammer transparency</h1>
        <p>my time in technology has been filled with scammers and fraudulent people, and these are some of them to look out for!</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h2>TZAudios Scam: tzaudiouk, tzaudios and any variation is FRAUD and a SCAM.</h2>
        <p>If you get a sponsorship email for your small channel saying they'd like to give you a free microphone its fake! Do not do it!</p>
        <p>They will send you 50 dollars on PayPal to make it seem legit but then they ask for your order Id to possibly get referral money and they <strong>do NOT REIMBURSE YOU, NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY</strong>.</p>
        <p>Tz audio products are real products, but a lot of these websites are SCAMS. Only order on amazon from the trusted sellers, and not the fake ones! It's super trippy.</p>
        <p>Also, no company shows their collaborations that went wrong, so its super sketchy and weird. They try to <strong>guilt trip</strong> you into buying it and following their plan!</p>
        <h3>DO NOT BELIEVE THEIR SCAM.</h3>
