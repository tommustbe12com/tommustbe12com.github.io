                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p class="warning">Here you will learn about the origins of skibidi toilet. Skibidi toilet is a brainrot series designed to make you dumber. Please don't watch it as it will fry your brain and quite literally turn your brain to mush.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for listening to the warning. Now let's get into it.</p>
        
                    <h2>Starting Out</h2>
                    <p>It started with dafuqboom doing his first skibidi toilet episode. There were many people that didn't know anything about skibidi, and didn't even know about anything that was upcoming.</p>
                    <p>After it got released, it received insane amounts of views, and it was extremely popular. With his newfound popularity, dafuqboom continued to create these brainrot videos about people in toilets.</p>
                    <p>Skibidi Toilet, after a couple episodes, amassed a popular catchphrase, <b>skibidi dop dop dop yes yes</b>, and had blown up on YouTube, causing other channels to recreate/copy their own versions of skibidi toilet. It was all brainrotting young kids - ages 2-10 to be specific - and it was heartbreaking to parents when their kids would look at them with beady eyes asking 'Skibidi dop dop dop yes yes?'</p>
                    <p>Doctors took action immediately after the 12th episode or so, with newfound information from a brain imaging lab near massive accumulation of skibidi toilet lovers. They said restricting anyone, kids and adults alike, to 1 minute of skibidi toilet a day would be sufficient for their mental health and wellbeing. Parents didn't heed the words of the doctors, and the kids kept on getting more and more brainrotted, watching it as they pleased.</p>
        
                    <h2>The Music</h2>
                    <p>While the music wasn't directly correlated to dafuqboom, it is world-wide known as the 'skibidi toilet song'. The song, originally titled skibidi, has gained massive amounts of views on YouTube, Spotify, and other streaming/music services.</p>
                    <p>It is a remix of two semi-popular songs, and was very popular amongst sussters and skibidiers alike. Brainrotted kids were the majority of the likes/views/whatever, but adults were also looking at it through their kids' suggestions.</p>
                    <p>While dafuqboom tried to include some older popular songs along with the main song to try to get parents to view the series, it didn't work as expected. It turns out it takes more than just music to make adults interested in an animated, crappy-graphic series, let alone watch it as a family.</p>
        
                    <h2>Later on</h2>
                    <p>Skibidi toilet has amassed dafuqboom over 30 million subscribers and over 1 billion views. And this just goes to show, anything can go viral on the internet, because what started out as a joke about a man in a toilet had become a booming internet trend.</p>
                    <p>After the initial popularity boost of skibidi toilet, dafuqboom switched his work over to skibidi toilet full time, and is currently still doing so. He even has a crappy brainrot Discord server for skibidi toilet, where sometimes you can even talk and communicate with him. So check that out if you're interested in skibidi toilet and brainrot things like it.</p>
                    <p>He creates disturbing, weird, and gross toilets in his basement, creating them with his end goals being:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Earn money</li>
                        <li>Earn views</li>
                        <li>Increase popularity</li>
                        <li>Make the world an overall worse place</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If you really want to, y'know, help with the last goal, you probably already have fulfilled it, leave us alone and watch your skibidi toilet.</p>
                    
                    <h2>My Opinions</h2>
                    <p>As you could probably tell throughout my writing, I am not thrilled or even one ounce intrigued or happy because of skibidi toilet. This also contributes to MY end goal being: DO NOT LET SKIBIDI TOILET BLOW UP!</p>
                    <p>In all serious though, maybe dafuqboom should try creating something that makes kids happy. Like real happy. Or encourages them to get off their IPad 21 MAX Ultra Pro Deluxe and touch grass. I'm glad I wasn't born in this current generation, and you should be too.</p>
                    <p>So, if you're going to take anything away from this blog post, please take away the fact that skibidi toilet is literal brainrot and should not exist or be put into people's lives. It gives them nightmares and will make them unsuccessful in life if they have no brain! Be grateful that you don't have to go through what kids are going through now, and fix the problem at hand. We can't have children watching skibidi toilet, or adults! It should be a U.S. law that skibidi toilet is not watchable in the United States. I'm not joking.</p>
        
                    <h2>What We Should Do & Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>I sort of kind of touched over this in the last section, but here's a more detailed overview:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Think about people's lives and how skibidi toilet is affecting them.</li>
                        <li>If you suspect anybody is into skibidi toilet, help them out. Don't look at them like they're weird. (They really are for watching skibidi toilet, but that's besides the point.)</li>
                        <li>Fine, if they don't want to touch grass, let them stay inside. But do NOT let them watch skibidi toilet.</li>
                        <li>Do not let anyone, especially children, fall into the evil scheme of dafuqboom</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Please listen to the following: We are under attack. Please help, and fix what is wrong in our brainrotted world.</p>
