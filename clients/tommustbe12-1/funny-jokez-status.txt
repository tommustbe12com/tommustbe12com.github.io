This Bot's Status:

Overall Development: 100%
Functionality Development: 100%
Command Development: 100%

More features are always going to be added, don't expect this to be the end of its updates!!

Additional information:

The ChatGPT command might not be the same as the real ChatGPT AI because the real one costs money for a bigger quota. However it still functions well, just takes a little longer to load (and isn't the actual ChatGPT).

Bot will still receive updates but not much anymore since development is pretty much over.
Also, nobody really uses the bot.
