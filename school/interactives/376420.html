        <h1>Scanning Gilgamesh Response</h1>
        <p>Gilgamesh was written nearly 4000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia for all we know. The epic was written by a man named Sîn-lēqi-unninni (yes I copy pasted that). The epic is a literary primary source. I know next to nothing about ancient Mesopotamia, but I do know that there were advanced civilizations for their time. I would like to know a lot about this era because it is very interesting and I really liked the Gilgamesh book which had a lot of clues as to what it was like back then, but learning in class will help me get a better bigger picture. I'm not sure if there is anything that makes this source less credible because it was written so long ago. Perhaps. Nah. I'm not even gonna answer this one. I previously mentioned I didn't know barely anything about ancient Mesopotamia. I don't know if it accurately reflects it because A) i didn't live in that time period and B) I know barely anything about the subject.</p>
